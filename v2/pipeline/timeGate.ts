// TimeGate — hour-of-day + day-of-week entry filter (2026-05-06)
// ============================================
// Data-discovered overlay applied to TREND + MOMENTUM signal generation.
//
// Pattern (validated on 132K training_trades + 137 v2 production trades):
//   * Hour 12 UTC (NY open):           best WR (66.9% / 85.7% v2)
//   * Hour 14, 17, 21 UTC:             consistently profitable
//   * Hour 13, 20 UTC:                 consistently worst (33-44% WR, large negative PnL)
//   * Friday:                           catastrophic (40.5% WR, -$9.8M training)
//   * Sunday:                           best (58.8% WR, +$8.6M training)
//
// Strategy:
//   * BLOCK signals during hard-block hours (entry rejected regardless of score)
//   * BLOCK signals on Friday (full-day veto)
//   * BOOST entries during top hours by lowering the score threshold
//   * NEUTRAL hours pass through unchanged
//
// Implementation note: takes optional timestamp arg so backtests can pass
// the candle's `time` (live engine omits → uses Date.now()).
